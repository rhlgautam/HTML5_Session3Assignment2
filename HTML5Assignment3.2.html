			Anybody with just basic knowledge of HTML and CSS can start using Bootstrap
			: Bootstrap's responsive CSS adjusts to phones, tablets, and desktops
			: In Bootstrap 3, mobile-first styles are part of the core framework
			: Bootstrap is compatible with all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, and Opera)
			— All Bootstrap components share the same design templates and styles through a central library, so that the designs and layouts of your web pages are consistent throughout your development.

			Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.
			An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page:

			An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.

			A "positioned" element is one whose position is anything except static.

			Because the image has a z-index of -1, it will be placed behind the text
